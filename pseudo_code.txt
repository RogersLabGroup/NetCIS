Outline for NetCIS

Use networkx in python for network construction and (maybe?) analysis

Preprocess data
    cutadapt to trim adapter and SB tags
    map reads to reference with bowtie2
    output as bam files
    *change bam files to bed files, one insertion site per line?

Read in data
    use pandas to read in tabular data
    convert to numpy data structures

Construct network (using pseudo code from graph framework article)
    
    Split insertion sites (IS) by chromosome
    Order IS for each chromosome
    for each IS(i)
        add node(i) as an IS location into the network
        for each node (j) in the network
            if distance between node(i) and node(j) is less than threshold
                add edge(ij) with a weight of the distance (or inverse?) to the network 
    
    split transcriptional element (TE) by chromosomes
    order TE for each chromosome 
    for each TE(i)
        add node(i) as a TE location into the network
        for each node (j) in the graph
            if distance between node(i) and node(j) is less than threshold
                add edge(ij) with a weight of the distance (or inverse?) to the network
    
Analyze network 
    export network into CytoScape and analyze there
    OR
    use networkx for analysis

    for each connected subgraph in the graph
        if subgraph is not a random network
            add subgraph to list of non-random CIS

    Explore non-random CIS

    Somehow get a p-value of each CIS
